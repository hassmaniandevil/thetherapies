  overview: 'Dialectical Behaviour Therapy is a comprehensive, evidence-based psychological therapy originally developed by Marsha Linehan for people with severe emotional dysregulation and chronic suicidality, particularly borderline personality disorder (BPD). It combines behavioural change strategies with acceptance-based approaches drawn from Zen mindfulness practice. DBT is structured as a programme rather than a standalone individual therapy.',
  overviewExtra: 'The \u201cdialectical\u201d in DBT refers to the balance between acceptance and change \u2014 validating the person\u2019s experience while also working toward meaningful behavioural change. DBT is not simply skills training; it is a multi-component treatment system.',
  content: {
    focus: 'Improving emotion regulation, distress tolerance, interpersonal effectiveness, and mindfulness. DBT addresses life-threatening behaviours first, then therapy-interfering behaviours, then quality-of-life issues, in a clear hierarchy.',
    sessionsLike: [
      'Full DBT programme includes four components: individual therapy, skills group, between-session coaching, and therapist consultation team',
      'Individual sessions: 50\u201360 minutes weekly',
      'Skills group: 2\u20132.5 hours weekly, typically runs for 24\u201332 weeks',
      'Between-session phone/text coaching for crisis support',
      'Programme-based: typically 12 months minimum for standard DBT',

    suitedFor: ['People with severe emotional dysregulation', 'Individuals with chronic self-harm or suicidal behaviour', 'Those who need both validation and practical skills', 'People who benefit from structured programmes with multiple support components'],
    adaptingNeeded: ['Active psychosis without stabilisation', 'Unable to commit to programme structure (attendance at both individual and group)', 'Where a full DBT programme is not available, DBT skills-informed approaches are not equivalent to comprehensive DBT'],
    theoreticalModel: 'DBT is grounded in the biosocial theory, which proposes that emotional dysregulation arises from a transaction between biological vulnerability (high emotional sensitivity, high reactivity, slow return to baseline) and an invalidating environment (one that punishes, dismisses, or intermittently reinforces emotional expression). This transaction produces pervasive difficulties in emotion regulation, which drive the behavioural problems targeted in DBT.\n\nThe dialectical philosophy underpins the treatment: the core dialectic is between acceptance (validation, mindfulness) and change (behavioural skills, problem-solving). DBT synthesises these through specific strategies including validation at multiple levels, dialectical strategies, and structured skills teaching across four modules:\n\n1. **Mindfulness**: Core awareness skills\n2. **Distress Tolerance**: Surviving crises without making things worse\n3. **Emotion Regulation**: Understanding and managing emotions\n4. **Interpersonal Effectiveness**: Navigating relationships while maintaining self-respect',
