Schemas are maintained through three maladaptive coping styles: surrender, avoidance, and overcompensation.

  overview: 'Emotionally Focused Therapy for couples is a structured therapy based on attachment theory, developed by Sue Johnson. It aims to improve emotional bonds and relationship security by identifying negative interaction cycles and fostering secure attachment between partners.',
  content: {
    focus: 'Identifying negative interaction cycles (e.g., pursue\u2013withdraw) driven by unmet attachment needs, and fostering new emotional engagement between partners.',
    sessionsLike: ['Couples sessions: 50\u201375 minutes', 'Frequency: Weekly or fortnightly', 'Time-limited: Typically 8\u201320 sessions', 'Three stages: de-escalation, restructuring interaction, consolidation'],
    commonUses: ['Relationship distress', 'Communication breakdowns', 'Attachment injuries (e.g., infidelity, betrayal)', 'Couples affected by individual mental health difficulties'],
    suitedFor: ['Couples who want to understand the emotional roots of their conflicts', 'Partners who are willing to be vulnerable with each other', 'Relationships where both partners are committed to change'],
    adaptingNeeded: ['Active domestic violence (contraindicated without specialist assessment)', 'Active substance abuse without treatment', 'Where one partner has decided to leave'],
    theoreticalModel: 'EFT integrates attachment theory (Bowlby), experiential therapy, and systemic theory. It proposes that relationship distress stems from insecure attachment bonds and the negative interaction cycles that maintain them. Partners\u2019 surface behaviours (criticism, withdrawal) are understood as attachment strategies driven by deeper emotional needs (safety, connection, reassurance).',
