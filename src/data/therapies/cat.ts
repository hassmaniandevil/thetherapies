  overview: 'Cognitive Analytic Therapy (CAT) is a time-limited, relationally focused integrative psychological therapy that draws on cognitive psychology, psychoanalytic object relations theory, and activity theory (Vygotskian developmental psychology). Developed by Anthony Ryle in the 1980s, CAT helps people understand and change longstanding patterns of thinking, feeling, and relating that cause ongoing distress. It places particular emphasis on understanding how early relational experiences shape current patterns, and uses unique collaborative tools \u2014 including reformulation letters and diagrams \u2014 to make these patterns visible and open to change.',
  overviewExtra: 'CAT is not simply a blend of CBT and psychoanalysis. It has its own distinct theoretical model \u2014 the Procedural Sequence Object Relations Model (PSORM) \u2014 its own tools (sequential diagrammatic reformulation, reformulation and goodbye letters, the Psychotherapy File), and its own understanding of how distress is maintained through repeating relational procedures. Developed by Dr Anthony Ryle at Guy\u2019s Hospital, London, in the 1980s as a public health response to the mental health needs of an inner London population, CAT was designed from the outset to be effective, collaborative, and deliverable within the resources of the NHS. It is inherently collaborative: the therapist and client build a shared understanding together, with the client\u2019s voice central to the process. The therapy honours the reality that many difficulties arise from difficult early experiences and relationships \u2014 framing early coping strategies as having been necessary for emotional survival rather than pathologising them.',
  content: {
    focus: 'CAT helps people recognise repeating patterns \u2014 called \u201cprocedures\u201d \u2014 in how they think, feel, act, and relate to others and themselves. These patterns often developed as understandable responses to early life experiences, but may now cause difficulties. The therapy uses collaboratively created written and visual tools to map these patterns, making them easier to recognise in daily life and creating space to develop alternative, more helpful ways of responding.\n\nA central idea in CAT is that of \u201creciprocal roles\u201d: the paired relational positions we learned early in life (for example, \u201ccritical\u2013criticised\u201d or \u201cneglecting\u2013neglected\u201d). These roles shape how we expect to be treated and how we treat ourselves and others. CAT helps people see these patterns clearly, recognise when they are being enacted, and gradually develop new relational possibilities.',

    ],
    theoreticalModel: 'CAT is grounded in the **Procedural Sequence Object Relations Model (PSORM)**, a distinct integrative framework drawing on multiple theoretical traditions:\n\n1. **Cognitive psychology**: The Procedural Sequence Model describes how mental processes unfold in sequences \u2014 from perception, through appraisal, to action and evaluation of consequences. When these sequences become rigid or self-defeating, they form **traps** (vicious circles where coping responses worsen the original problem), **dilemmas** (false either/or choices derived from repertory grid studies), and **snags** (self-sabotage at the point of change, often linked to unconscious guilt or fear of loss).\n\n2. **Psychoanalytic object relations theory**: CAT integrates ideas from Klein and Winnicott about how early relationships shape internal representations of self and others, restated in more cognitive language. The concept of **reciprocal roles** \u2014 internalised relational templates learned through early care experiences \u2014 is central. Described in the CAT literature as \u201cthe mother of all ideas,\u201d reciprocal roles are not simply cognitive schemas but felt, enacted relational positions that organise emotional life. Both poles of every reciprocal role must be identified (e.g., \u201ccriticising\u2013criticised\u201d).\n\n3. **Vygotskian developmental psychology (activity theory)**: Introduced to CAT by Mikael Leiman, this tradition provides the theoretical basis for CAT\u2019s collaborative tools. Vygotsky\u2019s concept of the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD) \u2014 what a person can achieve with scaffolding that they cannot yet achieve alone \u2014 is applied to the therapeutic relationship. The reformulation letter, SDR, and other tools function as psychological scaffolding.\n\n4. **Bakhtinian dialogism**: The dialogical perspective views the self as permeable and socially constructed, generating and responding to other selves through language and interaction. This enriches CAT\u2019s understanding of how self-states relate to each other internally.\n\n5. **George Kelly\u2019s Personal Construct Psychology**: Particularly the repertory grid technique (influential in early CAT research) and the non-authoritarian therapeutic stance.\n\nFor more complex presentations, particularly personality disorders, CAT uses the **Multiple Self States Model (MSSM)**, which conceptualises identity disturbance as a spectrum from relatively integrated personality to fragmented self-states. Self-states are recognised by a typical mood, a particular sense of self and others, and how far one is in touch with and in control of feelings.\n\nThe model proposes that psychological distress is maintained by **Reciprocal Role Procedures (RRPs)** \u2014 habitual patterns of perceiving, thinking, feeling, acting, and evaluating, organised around reciprocal roles learned in early relationships. Change occurs through the \u201c3 Rs\u201d: Reformulation (building a shared understanding), Recognition (noticing patterns as they occur), and Revision (developing \u201cexits\u201d \u2014 new ways of responding).\n\nThe therapeutic relationship itself is understood as a context in which reciprocal roles will be enacted (procedural transference), offering opportunities for collaborative recognition and revision. The therapist aims to occupy a position of genuine collaboration \u2014 ACAT emphasises that \u201cthere is no client\u2013patient hierarchy.\u201d',

    evidenceGuidelineSupport: 'CAT is widely used within UK NHS services and has a growing international evidence base. It is not yet included as a standalone NICE guideline recommendation for specific conditions in the way CBT is, but it is recognised in specialist pathways and service-level recommendations, particularly for personality difficulties and complex presentations. NICE CG78 (borderline personality disorder) acknowledges a range of structured psychological therapies, and CAT is frequently offered within NHS personality disorder services. ACAT (the Association for Cognitive Analytic Therapy) maintains a repository of research evidence.',
    evidenceStrength: 'Moderate overall; strongest for complex and relational difficulties, personality disorders, and presentations involving recurrent patterns. A meta-analysis of 11 outcome studies (324 patients) found an average effect size of 0.83 (95% CI 0.66\u20131.00) \u2014 a large effect. The Calvert & Kellett (2014) systematic review identified 25 outcome studies including 5 RCTs, with 44% focused on personality disorder. The Hallam et al. (2021) meta-analysis found CAT useful across a range of presentations, with patients particularly appearing to benefit interpersonally. An eight-session CAT showed similar levels of change to CBT for common mental health conditions. The evidence base is smaller than for CBT but is expanding, with particular strengths in areas where standard CBT is less well-evidenced (e.g., complex personality presentations, relational difficulties, dissociation).',
    evidenceLimitations: 'The RCT evidence base for CAT is still developing, and large-scale multi-site trials are limited. Much of the evidence comes from single-site studies, case series, and practice-based research. Head-to-head comparisons with other therapies are few. Therapist skill, training quality, and relational competence are critical variables that are harder to control in research designs. CAT\u2019s integrative and relational nature makes it less amenable to the component-dismantling research designs that favour manualised symptom-focused therapies.',
