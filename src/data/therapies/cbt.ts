  overview: 'Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT) is a structured, time-limited psychological therapy that helps people understand how their thoughts, behaviours, and physical responses interact to maintain emotional distress. It focuses on present-day difficulties and aims to develop practical skills that can be used beyond therapy.',
  overviewExtra: 'CBT is not about positive thinking or ignoring emotions. It is a collaborative, skills-based approach grounded in psychological science. It draws on both cognitive models (how we interpret situations) and behavioural principles (how actions and avoidance maintain problems).',
  content: {
    focus: 'CBT helps people notice unhelpful thinking patterns, behaviours, and coping strategies that keep problems going, and gradually replace them with more adaptive alternatives. The approach is collaborative: therapist and client work together to understand the problem, set goals, and test new ways of responding.',

    ],
    theoreticalModel: 'CBT is based on cognitive and behavioural learning theories. The cognitive model, developed by Aaron Beck, proposes that emotional distress is maintained by interactions between thoughts (cognitions), behaviours, physical sensations, and environmental context. Negative automatic thoughts, intermediate beliefs (rules and assumptions), and core beliefs form a hierarchy of cognition that shapes emotional responses. Behavioural components draw on classical and operant conditioning, emphasising how avoidance, safety behaviours, and reinforcement patterns maintain distress.',
    mechanismsOfChange: [
      'Cognitive restructuring: identifying and evaluating unhelpful automatic thoughts and underlying beliefs',
      'Behavioural activation: increasing engagement in valued activities to counter withdrawal and low mood',
      'Exposure and response prevention: graduated confrontation of feared stimuli while reducing safety behaviours',
      'Behavioural experiments: testing predictions and beliefs through planned real-world tasks',
      'Development of metacognitive awareness: learning to observe thought processes rather than being governed by them',
      'Increased self-efficacy and mastery through skills practice',
      'Reduction of avoidance and safety behaviours that maintain threat appraisals',

    evidenceGuidelineSupport: 'Strong and consistent. CBT is recommended by NICE guidelines for depression (NG222), generalised anxiety disorder (CG113), panic disorder (CG113), social anxiety disorder (CG159), OCD (CG31), PTSD (NG116 \u2014 trauma-focused CBT), eating disorders (NG69 \u2014 CBT-E), psychosis (CG178 \u2014 CBTp), and insomnia. The APA similarly recommends CBT for multiple conditions. The WHO includes CBT in its mental health intervention guidelines.',
    evidenceStrength: 'Strong across multiple conditions. CBT has the largest evidence base of any psychological therapy, with hundreds of randomised controlled trials and multiple meta-analyses demonstrating efficacy across a wide range of presentations.',
    evidenceLimitations: 'Effect sizes vary by condition and population. Therapist competence, adherence to protocol, and quality of formulation significantly affect outcomes. CBT may be less effective when delivered without adequate training or when the formulation does not match the presenting problem. Drop-out rates can be notable in some populations. The evidence base is stronger for some conditions (e.g., anxiety disorders, depression) than others (e.g., complex trauma, personality disorders without adaptation).',
