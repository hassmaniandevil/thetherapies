  overview: 'Behavioural Activation is a structured psychological therapy that focuses on increasing engagement in meaningful activities to improve mood. It is grounded in behavioural models of depression and emphasises action before motivation \u2014 the principle that waiting to feel better before doing things keeps people stuck.',
  content: {
    focus: 'BA targets avoidance and withdrawal, helping people reconnect with activities linked to pleasure, meaning, and accomplishment. Rather than working primarily with thoughts (as in full CBT), BA works directly with what people do and how that affects how they feel.',
    sessionsLike: [
      'Session length: 30\u201360 minutes',
      'Frequency: Weekly',
      'Time-limited: Yes (commonly 8\u201316 sessions)',
      'Between-session work: Activity planning, monitoring, and tracking mood alongside activities',
    ],
    commonUses: ['Depression', 'Low mood associated with chronic illness', 'Post-depressive relapse prevention', 'Withdrawal and inactivity linked to grief or loss'],
    suitedFor: ['People feeling stuck or withdrawn', 'Those who find cognitive approaches overwhelming or unhelpful', 'Individuals preferring action-based, practical therapy', 'People early in treatment who need momentum'],
    adaptingNeeded: ['Severe anhedonia may require additional scaffolding', 'Active suicidality requires integrated risk management', 'Physical health limitations may require adapted activity planning'],
    theoreticalModel: 'BA is based on behavioural theories of depression, particularly the work of Lewinsohn and later Martell, Addis, and Jacobson. The model proposes that depression is maintained by reduced contact with positive environmental reinforcement. When people withdraw, they lose access to the activities and social contacts that previously sustained their mood, creating a vicious cycle of inactivity and worsening low mood. BA directly targets this cycle by systematically increasing engagement with valued, rewarding activities.',
    mechanismsOfChange: ['Increased positive reinforcement from environment', 'Reduced behavioural avoidance and withdrawal', 'Re-engagement with valued roles and activities', 'Breaking the inactivity\u2013low mood cycle', 'Increased sense of mastery and accomplishment'],

    evidenceStrength: 'Strong for depression. Multiple RCTs and meta-analyses demonstrate effectiveness comparable to full CBT for depression.',
    evidenceLimitations: 'Evidence is strongest for depression; less evidence for anxiety disorders as a standalone treatment. The simplicity of BA may be insufficient for complex presentations requiring cognitive or relational work.',
