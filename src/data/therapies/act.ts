  overview: 'Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT, pronounced as a single word) is a behavioural therapy that helps people develop psychological flexibility \u2014 the ability to be present with difficult thoughts and feelings without being controlled by them, while moving toward what matters most. Rather than trying to eliminate distressing internal experiences, ACT changes the relationship people have with them.',
  content: {
    focus: 'ACT helps people move toward meaningful life directions while learning to respond differently to distressing internal experiences. It is built around six core processes (the \u201chexaflex\u201d): acceptance, cognitive defusion, present-moment awareness, self-as-context, values, and committed action.',
    sessionsLike: [
      'Session length: 45\u201360 minutes',
      'Frequency: Weekly or flexibly scheduled',
      'Time-limited or flexible depending on presentation',
      'Experiential exercises are common \u2014 ACT uses metaphors, mindfulness, and in-session exercises rather than purely verbal discussion',
      'Between-session practice encouraged: values-based action plans, mindfulness, defusion exercises',
    ],
    commonUses: ['Anxiety disorders', 'Depression', 'Chronic pain', 'Stress-related difficulties', 'OCD (as adjunct or alternative)', 'Substance use', 'Psychosis (adapted)', 'Health conditions requiring psychological adjustment'],
    suitedFor: ['People interested in mindfulness-based approaches', 'Those who have found thought-challenging approaches unhelpful or exhausting', 'Individuals seeking meaning-focused therapy', 'People who want to live well alongside ongoing difficulties rather than waiting to be \u201cfixed\u201d'],
    adaptingNeeded: ['Severe dissociation without stabilisation', 'Acute psychosis (adapted approaches exist)', 'Where the primary need is for structured behavioural intervention (e.g., severe OCD may benefit from ERP first)'],
    theoreticalModel: 'ACT is grounded in functional contextualism and Relational Frame Theory (RFT), a behavioural account of human language and cognition. RFT proposes that human suffering is partly a product of how language creates and elaborates psychological content (e.g., worry, rumination, self-criticism). ACT targets psychological inflexibility \u2014 the dominance of verbal/cognitive processes over direct experience and valued action \u2014 through six interconnected processes:\n\n1. **Acceptance**: Willingness to experience difficult thoughts/feelings without avoidance\n2. **Cognitive defusion**: Changing the function of thoughts rather than their content\n3. **Present-moment awareness**: Flexible, non-judgemental contact with the present\n4. **Self-as-context**: Experiencing a sense of self that is larger than any particular thought or feeling\n5. **Values**: Clarifying what matters most in life\n6. **Committed action**: Taking concrete steps toward valued living',
    mechanismsOfChange: ['Increased psychological flexibility', 'Reduced experiential avoidance (attempts to control or suppress internal experiences)', 'Cognitive defusion (reduced literal belief in thought content)', 'Increased values-guided behaviour', 'Enhanced present-moment awareness', 'Broader, more flexible sense of self'],
